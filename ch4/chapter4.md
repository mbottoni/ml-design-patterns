# Model Training patterns


- Usefull Overfitting
    - without any way to prevent overfitting
    - lookup tables
    - monte carlo methods
    - deep galerkin method
    - knowledge distillation

- Checkpoints
    - adding intermediate savepoints

- Transfer Learning
    - bottleneck layer

- Distribution
    - number of params
    - mirrored strategy tensorflow
    - model parallelism vs data parallelism
    - batch size is important

- Hyperparameter tunning
