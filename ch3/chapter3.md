# Problem representation design patterns


- reframing
- multilabel
    - sigmoid vs softmax

- ensembles
    - bagging vs boosting vs stacking
    - dropout as bagging
    - bias vs variance

- cascade
    - input of a model is the output of another
    - kubeflow pipelines

- neutral class

- rebalancing
