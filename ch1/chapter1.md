## What are design patterns

```
Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environ‐ ment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.
Each solution is stated in such a way that it gives the essential field of relationships needed to solve the problem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you can solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions at the place where you are making it.

# Summary

Design patterns are a way to codify the knowledge and experience of experts into advice that all practitioners can follow. The design patterns in this book capture best practices and solutions to commonly occurring problems in designing, building, and deploying machine learning systems. The common challenges in machine learning tend to revolve around data quality, reproducibility, data drift, scale, and having to satisfy multiple objectives.
We tend to use different ML design patterns at different stages of the ML life cycle. There are patterns that are useful in problem framing and assessing feasibility. The majority of patterns address either development or deployment, and quite a few pat‐ terns address the interplay between these stages.
